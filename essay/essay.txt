I have always envisioned myself walking through the courtyards and streets near Harvard, and the school colors look great with my hair color. These are reasons 34 and 35 why I want to attend Harvard.

Of course, everyone tells me I should keep those to myself and only share the top 3 reasons with you, beloved admissions committee. However, you've heard my top 3 reasons before - I don't need to rehash what every other desperate applicant has already made abundantly clear. So how about this, dear committee - I have never told anyone reason #4 before, so I will share it with you. Promise me you will not disclose the the reason to anyone unless you accept me into your program.

My fourth most important reason for attending Harvard is quite personal, and perhaps even difficult to convey to complete strangers such as yourselves. It may take you a moment to comprehend just what I say. Please take a deep breath, and spend a mindful moment to put yourself in my shoes. You are very attached to your keyboard, a simple USB plug-in with backlit, mechanical keys, set to Dvorak key-bindings. You have used this keyboard your whole (teenage) life. It has lasted you three computers so far. And the left side of the keyboard has become less responsive, so typing words that can be completed on the right side is vastly preferred. Now, Harvard itself is not perfect in that regard, having two two A's in its name. But even if I write HRVRD, people will basically know what I mean.

And that is my fourth most important reason for applying to your fine university. Of course, I needn't mention that the university I attend will be typed copiously, every day, to everyone on Discord, becoming one of my most most typed words for the next several years. I hope you take my situation - and keyboard - into account when forming your freshman class. My keyboard and I will soon grace HRVRD SR with our presence....
