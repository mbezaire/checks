A defining force in my life has always been my family. They are very important to me. As an example, this essay prompt asked why I would like to attend Harvard University. And my answer is very simple: itâ€™s within driving distance of home. I can head home on the weekends, no problem. But I can also drop in for dinner with my parents, do some laundry, and get help with my college homework (my mom is an engineer and my dad is a writer - we got all subjects covered!) on a Tuesday night if I need to.

Truthfully, I would be happy with MIT or Harvard, as they are both a short distance from home. My family would be heartbroken if I went all the way to Amherst, or out of state to some place like Brown. I hope you can see how much joy it would bring to their lives if you were to find a spot for me in your incoming class. Thank you.
